                <p>Selicia Yao is a cross-disciplinary multi-media digital artist based on London/Guangzhou. 
                    She got her bachelor degree in Digital Media Arts and now studying Computational Arts in Goldsmiths, University of London.</p> 
                <p>As a cross-disciplinary artist, she is fascinated by the intersections of art, technology, 
                    and the human experience. Her work spans multiple mediums, including moving images, fiction writing, VR game and interactive installations. 
                    Currently, she is particularly interested in the exciting possibilities presented by machine learning and machine vision, 
                    as well as mixed reality development. Through these cutting-edge technologies, 
                    she is exploring the boundaries between reality and virtuality, and the dynamic relationship between the body, technology, and the world.</p>
                <p>Growing in millennials, my creative inspiration is drawn from the rich world of internet subcultures and social media contexts. 
                    Recently, she has been deeply engaged with the core aesthetic of the 2010s internet, and the ways in which our media environments and technologies are shaping our understanding of the world around us. 
                    In her work, she seeks to translate these complex themes and ideas into compelling visual experiences that invite viewers to engage with them on multiple levels.</p>
