            <h1>Find Me In Between</h1>
            <p>The concept originates from my feeling of time fragment, “I live in a time that does not 
                belong to the present, in the past, in the future, in a parallel time”. Time is often thought 
                of as linear, with a distinct beginning and end. However, physicists and philosophers 
                believe that time may be multidimensional and non-linear. For example, in relativity, 
                time and space are intertwined, and time appears to slow down near black holes. In 
                quantum mechanics, events occur simultaneously, rather than in a fixed order. If 
                time is not linear, can ‘I’ in different time zone meet up in a certain intersection point? 
                Would my body and mind be dual presence in the past and there could be interactions 
                between our future self and our past self? Or just my conscious and soul wandering in 
                the past and our physical bodies would continue to exist in the future timeline? Or 
                neither our physical bodies nor our souls would exist in the past timeline, but rather a 
                copy would be created in a parallel timeline?</p> 
            <p>The time travel is still an open question for physicist and philosopher, leaving room for 
                imagery. Inspired from films about time travel, I fictionally assume that my body can 
                produce a copy at every second, and my mind and soul can travel back to the past and 
                interact with my copy at that parallel timeline. To visualize this, I’m trying to use
                montage editing to emphasize discontinuity and the disconnection. The time-image 
                montage is often associated with the use of techniques such as the long take, the close-up, and the non-linear narrative structure, which serves to break the continuity and 
                create a sense of disjunction</p>
