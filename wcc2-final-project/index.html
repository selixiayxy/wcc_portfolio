                <p>“Liminal Labyrinth” is an exploration-based adventure VR game where players are invited to 
                    explore the dream, memory, liminal space through walking and interact with various places. 
                    Inspired by “The Backrooms”, an urban legend and creepypasta about a maze with no end that has 
                    empty office rooms in a moist yellow room and hallways. It originated from a post in reddit, and 
                    now developed into a web-series sic-fic [1] and also video game called “The Backrooms Game” . 
                    According to the legend, people would fall into backrooms when he were out of reality(noclip) in 
                    the wrong place. Many of backrooms’ scenes correlate to the notion of liminal space. A physical 
                    liminal space is something tangible that you can recognize as a pathway, passageway or portal. 
                    These places are transitory, meaning you’re supposed to pass through them on your way to 
                    something else. If you rest in a liminal space too long, transitions can become a destination instead 
                    [3].</p> 
                <p> Inspired by Backroom forum, Yume Nikki (2004), Anemoiapolis (2023), and Just More
                    Doors (2022), I intend to design an explorative experience of liminal spaces in virtual reality, 
                    creating an immersive experience for audiences and trying to evoke their different perceptions of 
                    abnormal space but quite familiar with.</p>
